my name is Felix, I am a PhD student research business and politcs links in resource-abundent, low-income countries.


## Why should we care about resource-abundant countries?

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        We are facing a skyrocketing demand for metals and minerals such as cobalt, copper, tantalum, tin, and tungsten.
        These commodities are crucial for a transition towards renewable energy and electric devices. At the same time remains the demand for fossil fuels at hight levels even under the 'Announced Pledges Scenario' where governments will, on average, retain their already made commitments to reduce $CO^{2}$ emissions in the future. The plot on the right shows demand estimations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the period 2010-2050.

## What does this mean for low countries?

        The second plot shows the share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for exports of oil- and minerals as well as resource taxation (UNU-WIDER 2023) for the 68 least developed countries in the world 5 between 2001 and 2022. Oil revenues are important, but mineral exports become increasingly important in recent years. Only a fraction of these commodity revenues are formally taxed. This highlights the importance of rent sharing agreements beyond formal taxation, especially between national governments and multinational enterprises.

## About my research
My research examines business and politics links in resource-abundent, low-income countries. I am particularly interested in the role of multinational enterprises in the extractive industries and
how financial flows relate to institutional development.
