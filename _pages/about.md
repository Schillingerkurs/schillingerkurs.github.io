I am a PhD fellow at EGB and interested in the political economy of developing countries.

My research examines how financial flows relate to institutional development.  Since data in this field is often of low quality, I spend a large share of my time on ways to process unstructured data from public records in developing countries. This includes data science techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) or network analysis. I leverage the outcomes of these efforts to conduct quantitative research and identify causal relations. 

Before joining EGB, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Development Economics Research Group (DERG) at the Department of Economics at KÃ¸benhavns Universitet (KU). I hold a Msc in Economics from KU and a Bsc in Economics from the University of Heidelberg.
