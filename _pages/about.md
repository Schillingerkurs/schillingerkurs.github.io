## Work Experience

### Research Fellow, CBS  (since 2024)

- After defending my [dissertation](https://research.cbs.dk/en/publications/essays-on-business-and-politics-in-resource-abundant-low-income-c), I continue conducting quantitative research on the political economy of resource-rich, low-income countries.
-  I collect, process and analyze unstructured administrative records and
satellite images.



### Graduate Research Assistant, KU (2019-2020)

- Part of the Development Economics Research Group at Kus Department of Economics
- Built a 1:1 ownership model of the formal private sector in Mozambique since 1975.
- Parsed semi-unstructured administrative records to observe the ownership structure of all registered firms.

### Freelance Economic Consultant, QBIS (2019)

- Performed empirical estimations of the effects of privatizations on trade volumes.


## Projects

- **Mining activities and their legal status**: This data [project](https://schillingerkurs.github.io/projects/) compiles mining activities across Africa, utilizing academic publications, country-level datasets, and proprietary databases. It offers an extensive sample size to uncover both formal and informal mining sites, shedding light on mine performance and ownership structures. Addressing challenges like legal complexities and data opacity surrounding mining licenses, the project collaborates with Alan Jones to curate a comprehensive repository, offering descriptive statistics and insights into licensing conditions.


- **Beneficial ownership data in Mozambique**: Administrative records often lack availability and standardization, especially in low-income countries. In this [project](https://schillingerkurs.github.io/thesis/pages/econ_moz.html), I parse unstructured text data on firm ownership from a national gazette of Mozambique, containing all formally registered entries since Mozambique’s independence, to gain micro-level insights into the Mozambican economy.
