I am a PhD fellow at the [Department of International Economics, Government and Business](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business) at the [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en).  I am an applied economist interested in the relationship between natural resource extraction, politics, and economic development.

My research focuses on property rights in low income countries. In my PhD thesis, I explore with quantitiave methods how elites maintain and protect rent capture opportunities in the private sector. I have experience working with large administrative- and unstructured datasets and combine geo-spatial analysis, causal inference and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in my research.

In addition to my current role, I previously served as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Development Economics Research Group ([DERG](https://www.econ.ku.dk/derg/)) at the Department of Economics, KÃ¸benhavns Universitet (KU). I hold an MSc in Economics from KU and a BSc in Economics from the University of Heidelberg.  I had the opportunity to be a Visiting Student Research Collaborator at the [Department of Politics, Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/) during the Spring Semester of 2023 and visited the [NOVAFRICA](https://novafrica.org/) Center at the Nova School of Business and Economics in March 2022.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me.
