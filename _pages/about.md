I am currently a PhD fellow at the Department of International Economics, Government and Business at the Copenhagen Business School. My research focuses on the intricate relationship between natural resource extraction, politics, and economic development in low income countries.

Studying these complex interactions with quantitative methods can be challenging. That's why I work with public but unstructured data and various data science techniques, including spatial analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My goal is to uncover valuable insights that shed light on the dynamics of resource-driven development, particularly linkages between political and economic actors.

In addition to my current role, I previously served as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Development Economics Research Group ([DERG](https://www.econ.ku.dk/derg/)) at the Department of Economics, KÃ¸benhavns Universitet (KU). I hold an MSc in Economics from KU and a BSc in Economics from the University of Heidelberg.  I had the opportunity to be a Visiting Student Research Collaborator at the [Department of Politics, Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/) during the Spring Semester of 2023 and visited the [NOVAFRICA](https://novafrica.org/) Center at the Nova School of Business and Economics in March 2022.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me.
