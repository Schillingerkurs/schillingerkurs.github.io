# Mining licenses in Africa

Natural resource extraction, particularly mining, holds paramount economic and political significance as it fuels economic expansion, facilitates employment opportunities, generates substantial revenue  in many low income countries. At the same time are these resources curicual to the global supply chain of electronic devices. However, studying mining activities and comprehending their legal status empirically presents inherent challenges due to the intricacies of the industry, variations in legal frameworks across different jurisdictions, the prevalence of informal and illicit mining practices, limited transparency in reporting, and the involvement of numerous stakeholders. Consequently, the comprehensive collection and analysis of data become arduous tasks.

In light of these challenges, in collaboration with [Alan Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanksjones/), we have curated a comprehensive data repository of mining licenses in various low-income countries. This section presents descriptive statistics pertaining to the current project stages, shedding light on the prevailing conditions in the mining sector.

## Example mining activities and licenses in Sierra Leone

The following interactiv map zooms in on Sierra Leone and lists details of mining licenses and existing measures of mining activities.

The listed categories include licenses for artisanal miner or small-scale mining (ASM), Exploration and Prospecting licensese as well as Porduction licenseses.

To compare these legel entities to actual mining, the map also plots mining areas defined by [Maus et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00624-w)  and the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/).
