This map lists all  rare earth mining licenses (red), deposits (brown) and production sides (black) that I found in my mining data repos.

The licenses are from each countries online cadastre (if a country has one), the deposits and productions side (n = 2) are from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/rare-earths-statistics-and-information).
